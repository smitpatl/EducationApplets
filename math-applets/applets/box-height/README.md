# Box Height Challenge Applet

This is a challenge-type applet that guides students through solving a problem about finding the height of a box with a given volume and dimensions.

## Problem Statement

The box below has a volume of 80 cm³, a length of 10 cm, and a width of 4 cm. Find the height of the box.

## Learning Objectives

- Apply volume formulas for rectangular prisms
- Practice algebraic manipulation to solve for an unknown variable
- Understand the relationship between volume and dimensions
- Develop dimensional analysis skills (understanding how units transform in calculations)
- Connect abstract measurements to real-world objects

## Applet Structure

The applet follows a 4-step approach:

1. **Comprehend**: Identify given information and what needs to be found
   - Given: Volume = 80 cm³, Length = 10 cm, Width = 4 cm
   - To Find: Height of the box

2. **Connect**: Link to prerequisite knowledge needed for solving
   - Formula for volume of a rectangular box: V = length × width × height
   - Algebraic manipulation to solve for height
   - Dimensional analysis: understanding how units transform (cm³ ÷ cm² = cm)

3. **Compute**: Work through the solution step-by-step
   - Apply the volume formula: 80 cm³ = 10 cm × 4 cm × height
   - Simplify: 80 cm³ = 40 cm² × height
   - Solve for height: height = 80 cm³ ÷ 40 cm² = 2 cm
   - Verify: 10 cm × 4 cm × 2 cm = 80 cm³

4. **Check**: Verify the answer through interactive elements
   - Interactive slider to check the solution with different height values
   - Real-world comparisons to help students visualize the result

## Enhanced Features

The applet includes several enhanced features to improve mathematical understanding:

- **Detailed Dimensional Analysis**: Clear explanations of how units transform during calculations (cm × cm × cm = cm³, cm³ ÷ cm² = cm)
- **Real-world Comparisons**: The final answer (2 cm) is compared to everyday objects like a CD jewel case and a US penny
- **Visual Step-by-step Solution**: The solution process is broken down into clear, visual steps
- **Interactive Verification**: Students can test different height values to see how they affect the volume

## Technical Implementation

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend
- JSXGraph for interactive geometric visualization
- Standalone HTML file with embedded libraries
- No external dependencies required

## Usage

This applet can be used by:
1. Opening the standalone HTML file in any modern web browser
2. Accessing it through the GitHub Pages site
